# LongYourDog

## Dev readme:

To clone this project:

    git clone https://github.com/SeijiEmery/LongYourDog.git
    cd LongYourDog
    git checkout <your-branch>
  
### Active dev branches:

    level-geometry-prototype  (Erwang)
    interaction-prototype     (Jack)
    movement-prototype        (Seiji)
  
### Only work in your respective unity scene and branch!

    LevelGeometryTestbed (Erwang)
    InteractionMechnicsTestbed (Jack)
    MovementTestbed (Seiji)
  
Any work in any other scene WILL be nuked when we merge.

Note: we're using different scenes b/c git is terrible at handling merges / collaboration in general between people working on the same scene. We don't have to all use the same scene for prototyping, ergo we won't. We can use prefabs + scripts to share stuff and will just work in our own scenes to build out stuff + mechanics. Thanks! -Seiji

### Pull requests

When you're done go to this git repo (on the web) and click 'Open new pull request'. See [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github) for details.

You should ONLY ever work in / commit changes to your branch. Changes made to any other branch, including master (the default) will be nuked / reverted. I'm putting in this policy so our dev process will be less painful.

I can talk about git and branching in more detail at our next meeting; in the meantime see the digital ocean tutorial above, which (I think) explains feature branches + pull requests, which is the model we'll be using for development.
